// Compiling is actually 4 steps:
// Preprocessing - Copy and paste #includes's prototypes to the top of the file, replacing #include with prototypes per header file.
// Compiling - Coverting high level programming language (C in this case) to assembly language
// Assembling - Converting assembly language to machine code.
// Linking - Combining all machine code into a single file (your code and other requried libraries)
