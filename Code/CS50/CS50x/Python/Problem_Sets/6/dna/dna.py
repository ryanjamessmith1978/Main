### DNA ###

# nucleotide contain one of four different bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T)
# STR is a short sequence of DNA bases that tends to repeat consecutively
# A row corresponds to an individual, and each column corresponds to a particular STR.

#  Take a sequence of DNA and a CSV file containing STR counts for a list of individuals
#  output to whom the DNA (most likely) belongs
